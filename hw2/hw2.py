    Implement the training and testing procedure here. You are permitted

    You are you are permitted to use the numpy library but you must write 
    your own code for the linear classifier. 

    Inputs:
        training_input: list form of the training file
            e.g. [[3, 5, 5, 5],[.3, .1, .4],[.3, .2, .1]...]

    Output:
